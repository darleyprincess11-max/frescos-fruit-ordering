🥝 Frescos: Country-Wide Fruit Ordering System

🎯 **Challenge & Solution**
This project simulates a full-cycle e-commerce platform dedicated to fresh produce. The goal was to move beyond static web design and develop a functional, data-driven application that demonstrates proficiency in both user interface design and foundational data modeling.
The primary solution involved architecting a client-side interaction layer (JavaScript) capable of processing orders and designing a robust, three-table relational database structure **(SQL/Access)** to efficiently manage product inventory and simulated transactions.
⚙️**Key Technical Achievements**
The development process yielded significant learning outcomes, particularly in system integration and complex logic handling:
Mastery of Client-Side Data Flow (JavaScript): Engineered the core logic for the shopping cart, utilizing ES6 JavaScript objects and arrays to dynamically store, update, and manage line items. Developed functions for real-time order total recalculation and pre-submission validation, ensuring a fluid user experience.
**Relational Database Modeling (SQL/Access**): Designed and implemented the underlying relational schema, defining crucial one-to-many relationships between the Products, Customers, and Orders tables. This exercise demonstrated an understanding of SQL constraints and the necessity of data normalization for integrity.
**Adaptive User Interface (HTML/CSS)**: Constructed a fully responsive front-end using HTML5 semantics and CSS Flexbox, ensuring the application adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, maintaining high product visibility and intuitive navigation on mobile and desktop devices.
**Enhanced Media Presentation**: **Leveraged Photoshop and** to create high-resolution, visually compelling product imagery, elevating the overall production quality of the platform.
