                We recommend starting with a box with 2 pieces of fruit per person per week. For a 25-person office:
                try
                a Harvest Mix, Large (50-servings), delivered weekly; and a Thoughtful Snacks Mix, Medium
                (75-servings),
                delivered every other week. Connect with us and we can help you craft a custom program
